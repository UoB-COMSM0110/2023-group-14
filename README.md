## **Game description**

In this game, the player will control a character who must climb up a series of platforms to reach Donkey Kong at the top. Donkey Kong will be throwing barrels down at the player, which the player must avoid or jump over. As the player progresses through the levels, the platform on which the player is standing will gradually disappear, making the game more difficult.

Overall, this stripped-back version of Donkey Kong will offer a fun and challenging gameplay experience for players of all ages and skill levels.

## **Requirements engineering**

- Create game graphics including the characters (player and Donkey Kong), platforms, ladders, and barrels.
- Implement player movement controls for moving left, right, jumping, and climbing ladders.
- Implement Donkey Kong's throwing of barrels, which will roll down the platforms toward the player.
- Implement collision detection between the player, platforms, ladders, and barrels to ensure proper gameplay mechanics.
- Implement the gradual decrease of platform size over time to increase difficulty.
- Add sound effects and music to enhance the player's experience.
- Implement a scoring system and high score leaderboard to encourage replayability and competition among players.
- Test the game thoroughly to ensure proper gameplay mechanics and minimize bugs.
- (optional: power ups to restore parts of the platform, sound effects and music, multiple levels)

## **Three main challenges**

1. Implementing the gradual decrease of platform size over time: This requires creating a timer or counter that decreases the size of the platform over time, while still ensuring that the player can move and jump on the platform. Additionally, you need to ensure that the platform size gradually decreases in a smooth and consistent manner to avoid jerky movements or glitches.
2. Implementing proper collision detection: This requires accurate detection of collisions between the player, platforms, ladders, and barrels, as well as implementing the appropriate actions for each collision. For example, if the player collides with a barrel, they may lose a life, while colliding with a power-up may provide a temporary boost to the player's abilities.
3. Balancing the game difficulty: Since the platform size gradually decreases over time, it can be challenging to ensure that the game remains fair and enjoyable for players of all skill levels. You'll need to balance the game's difficulty to ensure that it remains challenging but not frustratingly difficult, while also providing a sense of progression as the player advances through the game.
